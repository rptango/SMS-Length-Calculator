# Introduction
Many professionals and newcomers struggle to understand how messages are encoded, why certain character limits exist, and how this impacts SMS delivery. By explaining these concepts in simple terms I expect to provide clear understanding of SMS to developers, testers, and product/marketing managers to make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls in mobile messaging.

# Why the complexity ?
it all comes down to SMS packet size (please refer to http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/23040.htm for extra details)

The segmenting logic for GSM-7 and UCS-2 encoding follows these standards
